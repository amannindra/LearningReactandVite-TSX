I decided to start learning React/Vite. This is my first project with react. In this repo, I followed a video by "Programming with Mosh". I am half-way through the video. To test myself, I created a button in which the innerText will increase of 1 after it is clicked. I am going to create more projects in the future. Soon I will start integrating API's to react.
